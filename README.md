# e.commerce.website

Welcome to my E-Commerce Website!

This project isn't done yet, i'm still coding at it and will update soon new changes!

In creating this project i used *HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript ES6 / Bootstrap v4.5 / Font Awesome / Boxicons*

The content of the project has been generated with *html & css* but also generated by blending them with *json & javascript*

*New updates to come:*

- creating a data base for .json data

- creating the page 'Contact Us' and make it functional

- updating the page "My Account" with more features/functionalities

- creating and making "Search" functional

- overall, replace as much as possible the html code with javascript code
